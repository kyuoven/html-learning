Commenting is a way that you can leave comments for other developers within your code without affecting the resulting output that is displayed to the end user.

Commenting is also a convenient way to make code inactive without having to delete it entirely.

Uncomment your h1, h2 and p elements.

BEFORE:
-->

<!--
<h1>Hello World</h1>
