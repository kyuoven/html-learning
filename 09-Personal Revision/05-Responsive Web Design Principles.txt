    ! Media Queries consist of a media type, and if that media type matches the 
    type of device the document is displayed on, the styles are applied. You can 
    have as many selectors and styles inside your media query as you want.
    - @media (min-hieght: x px);
            p {
                font-size: x px;
                etc.
            }
    - @media (max-height x px);
            p {
                font-size: x px;
                etc.
            }
       
    -   max-width: 100%; 
        height: auto; = Responsive image with CSS.

    !The simplest way to make your images properly appear on High-Resolution Displays, such as the MacBook Pros "retina display" 
    is to define their width and height values as only half of what the original file is. Here is an example of an image that is 
    only using half of the original height and width:

    - <style>
        img { height: 250px; width: 250px; }
    </style>
    <img src="coolPic500x500" alt="A most excellent picture">
